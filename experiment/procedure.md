1. Fill the given liquid (or choose from the option)in the cylindrical column given
2. Choose the object (glass ball/ copper ball) which has to be dropped through the liquid
3. Note down the diameter of the glass ball, density of the glass ball, density of the liquid
4. Drop the glass ball from the top of the cylindrical column
5. Switch on the stop watch when the ball crosses the mark which is shown on the column
6. Note down the time taken by the ball to travel to reach the basement of the column
7. Find out the velocity from the above reading
8. Calculate the viscosity using the formula given, taking density of ball, liquid, and radius of the ball
